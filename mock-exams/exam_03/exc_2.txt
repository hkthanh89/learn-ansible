We have two nodes that are managed by Ansible. There is an inventory file ~/playbooks/inventory on Ansible controller which has all these two nodes added. Create a playbook ~/playbooks/blocks.yml on Ansible controller to install httpd web server and start its service.

Create the playbook using blocks to logically group the tasks (installation and service start).
