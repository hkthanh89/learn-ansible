Write a playbook /home/thor/playbooks/install_from_source.yml to install a tool: mosh from the source:https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh on all servers inside the inventory /home/thor/playbooks/inventory.

A normal install from source flow is:

git clone https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh
cd mosh
./autogen.sh
./configure
make && make install
To compile mosh from source, you need these dependencies:

git
make
autoconf
automake
protobuf-devel
libutempter-devel
ncurses-devel
openssl-devel
gcc
gcc-c++
